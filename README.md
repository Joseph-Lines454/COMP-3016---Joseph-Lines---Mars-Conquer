First Commit for the Evil Spaceman Game.

Overview of the game:
The game will be a fighting game. The idea of the game is that you are an evil spaceman. 
Your mission is to conquer Mars by fighting different heroes (aliens) from different 
sections of Mars. The space man will be able to kick, hit, block punches as well as have 
a special ability (shooting) – same goes for the alien. To put a unique twist on the game 
the spaceman and the aliens will be shooting fruit at eachover. Different types of fruit 
will be used by different aliens (as the game gets harder fruit does more damage). The 
game will include a health bar as well as a menu for different levels. 

The Dynamics of the game will build upon the mechanics. The player will be able to 
discover the different locations within the game as well as the aliens’ different special 
attacks (fruits) and potentially adapt to the different styles of fighting. As the enemies 
increase in difficulty, the game should get more competitive. The health bar element 
should also contribute to the competitiveness.

The style of the game will be pixelated. The aim of the game is to remind people of 
arcade games and potentially elicit nostalgia. Sound effects should allow for a more 
immersive experience and the background music will be reminiscent of arcade games.

Next Commit:

The next commit should include more assets for the game as well as the beginning of the class structure of the game.

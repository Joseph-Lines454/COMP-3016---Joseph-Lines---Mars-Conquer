Evil SpaceMan

GamePlay Description
The game starts of with the title screen. The user is then able to enter the next screen, providing some story on the game.
The aim of the game is for the player to defeat the planets hero/Alien three times, whilst the game gets continuously harder each round.
The player Can Kick, Punch and Croutch to dodge the Aliens Special attack. When the Alien's health gets low, that alien runs to the edge of the screen (retreats) and goes into defense mode.
The Alien then throws a fruit at the user which is designed to significantly decrease their health. The player is able to dodge this attack by croutching. The player is then able to attack the Alien, killing the alien.
If the user beats the Alien, the next round will commence where the Alien will get a bit harder (the amount of moves that they can throw is increased). The players Aim is to beat the Alien in all three rounds and if successfull,
they will have their score which is time based compared to the highest score. If they player falters in any round, the Alien wins and the player loses.
